## Change History Section Templates

Every file modified by a PR must carry a change history section. The format depends on the file type. Add one row per PR in ascending PR-number order. Use the GitHub API (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/files`) to confirm which files a PR actually changed — do not rely on `git log`.

### Shell and BATS files (`.sh`, `.bats`)

Place after the last executable statement, before EOF. The `return 0` guards against accidental direct execution and marks the boundary between executable content and metadata.

```bash
return 0

# --- Change History -------------------------------------------------------
# | PR     | Summary                                                       |
# |--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
# | #N     | one-line description                                          |
```

### RST documentation files (`.rst`)

Place at the end of the file. The `..` RST comment directive causes Sphinx to discard the block entirely; it never surfaces in built HTML or PDF output.

```rst
..

   Change History

   PR     Summary
   -----  -----------------------------------------------------------------
   #N     one-line description
```

Note: pipe-table syntax (`| col |`) must not be used inside RST `..` comments — the RST parser expands `|...|` as substitution references even inside comment blocks. Use plain aligned text columns instead.

### Skills `history.md` (SCM skill — tracks product→process causality)

A standalone file in the skill directory, **never referenced from skill content**. Records which product or process PRs drove each change to the skill files.

```markdown
# Change History

| PR  | Closes | Skill files changed | Process change |
|-----|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| #N  | #M     | filename.md         | one-line description |
```

### Skills `history.md` (all other skills)

```markdown
# Change History

| PR  | Closes | Summary |
|-----|--------|---------|
| #N  | #M     | one-line description |
```
